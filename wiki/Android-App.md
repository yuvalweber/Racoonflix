## **How to Run guide:**

first of all you can populate the data using our code and the backend will have dummy data
```bash
python ./backend/populateMongo.py
```

There are many ways to run the app we will show 2 ways:

1) using adb reverse tcp (from cmd windows):

you need to connect you android to your pc and activate usb debugging on the phone so he can be connected to android studio.
Then from cmd (windows) run:

```bash
%localappdata%\Android\Sdk\platform-tools\adb.exe reverse tcp:8080 tcp:8080
```

it will make your android to connect to localhost:8080 of the pc (which is where our api is)
no you can run the android app from android studio and interact with the api


2) using your device on the same wifi:

first find your pc's wifi.
using cmd write the following command:
```bash
ipconfig
```
and under wifi adpater look for the IPV4 address (save it in some notepad or something).

now go to our android app (open it in android studio) and go to the folder network
and open the RetrofitInstance.java file and change the BASE_URL to your ip.

now your app should work and everything should be wonderful ðŸ˜„
